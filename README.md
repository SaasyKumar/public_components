# Overview
This repository is structured as a **monorepo** to manage a collection of independent, versioned **npm packages**. It centralizes the development of shared code, primarily consisting of:

* **TypeScript Utility Functions** (for general logic, data manipulation, etc.)
* **Reusable React TypeScript Components** (`.tsx` files for UI elements)

The monorepo uses **TypeScript** exclusively to ensure type safety across all consumers.
